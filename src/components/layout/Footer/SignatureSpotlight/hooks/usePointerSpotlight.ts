/**
 * Lights the footer signature as the pointer approaches it, not only when the
 * pointer is directly over the glyphs. A window-level pointermove listener
 * (throttled to one read per animation frame) measures the pointer against
 * `targetRef` (the glyph layer) and writes three custom properties to it:
 *
 *   --pointer-x / --pointer-y  the spotlight circle's centre, in the glyph
 *                              box's own coordinates, so the mask stays aligned
 *                              even when the pointer sits outside the letters.
 *   --spotlight-opacity        how lit the reveal layer is: full over the
 *                              glyphs, fading to zero across a proximity margin
 *                              (REACH_*) that stretches farther above and to the
 *                              sides than below.
 *
 * Driving opacity from measured proximity, rather than the element's own :hover
 * box, is what lets the glow wake before the pointer reaches the letters, and
 * keeps the signature's own size and position untouched. Writes go straight to
 * the DOM, so the cursor path never re-renders React. No-ops on coarse /
 * hoverless pointers, so touch devices never attach a listener.
