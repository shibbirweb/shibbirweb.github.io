 * On a direct visit to a URL with a fragment (e.g. /#skills), glide smoothly to
 * that section instead of letting the browser snap to it.
 *
 * `scroll-behavior: smooth` on <html> makes the browser's own fragment scroll
 * unreliable: it can start before layout settles, get interrupted, and leave the
 * visitor short of the target. So we take over: snap to the top instantly (so the
 * move reads as a deliberate glide down rather than an abrupt jump), wait a beat
 * for fonts to settle the offset, then smooth-scroll to the section ourselves.
 * The section -> URL sync is held off for the duration so it does not rewrite the
 * hash to each section the glide passes through.
